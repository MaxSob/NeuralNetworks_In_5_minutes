# Neural Networks Notebooks
This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate the basic math and mechanism of deep neural networks.

## Neural Networks in 5 minutes
This Notebook includes a bare back simple Numpy implementation of a neural network. It includes:
*   Forward propagation
*   Cost compute
*   Backpropagation
*   Parameter update

## Activation function and derivatives
This Notebooks ilustrates math mechanism for different activation funcition and their respective derivatives. It includes:
*   Sigmoid
*   Tanh
*   Hard tanh
*   ReLU
*   Leaky ReLU
*   ELU
*   GELU
