[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2fcdb0e938584545892d15dec9c7d109)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/MaxSob/NeuralNetworks_In_5_minutes?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=MaxSob/NeuralNetworks_In_5_minutes&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate the basic math and mechanism of deep neural networks.

## Neural Networks in 5 minutes
This Notebook includes a bare back simple Numpy implementation of a neural network. It includes:
*   Forward propagation
*   Cost compute
*   Backpropagation
*   Parameter update

## Activation function and derivatives
This Notebooks ilustrates math mechanism for different activation funcition and their respective derivatives. It includes:
*   Sigmoid
*   Tanh
*   Hard tanh
*   ReLU
*   Leaky ReLU
*   ELU
*   GELU
